A collection of algorithms, experiments and insights into discrete optimisation problems (integer programming, combinatorial optimisation, heuristics).

This repository combines an overview of the [**Discrete Optimization**](https://www.coursera.org/learn/discrete-optimization) course offered on Coursera by Georgia Institute of Technology. It serves both as a course reference and a practical toolkit.
