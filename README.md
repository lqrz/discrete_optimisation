##  Course Overview

**Discrete Optimization** is an intermediate-level course designed to teach fundamental concepts and practical methods in combinatorial optimization.

- **Module 0 — Welcome**: Course philosophy, structure, grading, and assignment format
- **Module 1 — Knapsack**: Formulation, greedy heuristics, dynamic programming, branch-and-bound, relaxation, search strategies
- **Module 2 — Constraint Programming (CP)**: Principles of CP (propagation, global constraints, symmetry-breaking, search strategies); model examples like colorings, N-Queens, Sudoku, set cover
- **Module 3 — Local Search**: Neighborhoods, moves, meta-heuristics such as simulated annealing, tabu search, local improvements (e.g. 2-opt), large-neighborhood search
- **Module 4 — Linear Programming (LP)**: Simplex algorithm, duality principles :contentReference[oaicite:5]{index=5}  
- **Module 5 — Mixed Integer Programming (MIP)**: MIP modeling, branch-and-bound, cutting planes, Gomory cuts, branch-and-cut, polyhedral cuts; applied to problems like facility location, graph coloring, TSP
- **Module 6 — Advanced Topics I**: Constraint-programming techniques for scheduling and vehicle routing
- **Module 7 — Advanced Topics II**: Large Neighborhood Search and Column Generation methods
